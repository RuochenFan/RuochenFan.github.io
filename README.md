## About me

I am a master student at Computer Science department, Tsinghua University under the supervision of Prof. Shi-Min Hu. I currently focus on perception system for autonomous driving, especially for point cloud segmentation and RGB detection. Before that, I did some research on saliency detection and weakly-supervised segmentation.
